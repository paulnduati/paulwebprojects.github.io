        <h2 id="blog1">What scared me most during the pandemic</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 1-May-2021</h6>
        
        <p class="intro">Imagine this. You have been watching the news, seeing flyers plastered on walls all over town, it is right in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. You start feeling a difficulty in breathing... Uh-oh! Your mind starts racing. "I'm in trouble", it says. Because at that very moment, you are experiencing one of the symptoms of COVID-19 you've been seeing everywhere.</p>
        <p>In October 2020, I had a run-in with a rare chest infection. Allow me to provide a little context. I have a history of recurring common chest illnesses, more than the average person, especially when I'm exposed to <strong>cold weather</strong> or <strong>excessive dust</strong> and/or <strong>smoke</strong>. A fair few of the symptoms I feel when I'm coming down with a cold or flu overlap with the symptoms that were consistent with patients who tested positive for COVID-19, therefore, <em>I could never be too sure</em> about whether I was coming down with a cold or if I had contracted the virus, <em>but I did my best to stay healthy</em>. I did so to accord myself a little peace of mind and to assert some personal control over the chaos the pandemic had unleashed on my life.</p>
        <p>On this particular evening in October, I suddenly had no appetite, and when I tried to force down a few spoonfuls of supper, I was unable to eat. So I went to bed, thinking I might be coming down with something. <em>It was then that I started feeling a pain in my chest</em>, along the lower left of my rib cage, right below where my heart is. It was cold so I was having a little trouble breathing, but I told myself I'd probably just hit myself on something and the difficulty in breathing was nothing new, I sometimes even wheeze in my sleep when the cold is as bad, and I make it through the night and feel better in the morning, so I went to bed hoping my body would repair itself like it so often does and I'd wake up the following morning feeling like my cheerful, vibrant self.</p>
        <p>When I woke up the following morning, I didn't uncover myself immediately, I reached across the bed and grabbed my phone to go on social media like most young people do (read chuckling). I felt no pain in my chest immediately, and I was breathing normally, so I felt relieved. As I was using my phone however, my hands were outside the bed covers, and the cold started creeping into my fingers. People who have "freezing" hands and feet can relate. I started feeling the pain in my chest come back, but instead of being localized like the previous night, it was like a band stretching from under my left armpit along my lowest rib up to my sternum, and it was like a vice grip, and every breath I took was more painful than the last. Now I knew I was really in trouble. The lingering thought <em>"what if it is COVID"</em> from the previous night might as well have been screaming in my head at this point.</p>
        <p>So I did what any boy would do - I texted my elder brother and told him my symptoms. And the guy goes:</p>
        <p id="twist">"Bro don't be dying on us!"</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, when I tried having breakfast in the morning, I could barely taste the tea, let alone swallow it. I knew I had to go get checked, but I was scared of setting foot in a public hospital. After all, that is one of the places you are likely to come into contact with a COVID-19 patient or a person who's been infected and not yet aware, so I decided to go to a private one. Except, I barely had enough money to sustain myself as it was, so I got my brother to back me up with some cash and went to the ER, masked up, scared and alone.</p>
        <p>After waiting on the queue for what felt like an eternity, I finally got my consult with the doctor and was sent to the lab to have a blood sample drawn and tested. About half an hour later, I was summoned by the nurse, given a piece of paper by the doctor and told to go to the pharmacy, show them the piece of paper then take whatever drugs I paid for and go to an IV room. I still didn't know what I was coming down with, but to my immense relief, there were no strange people dressed in PEP's coming to take me to what I could only imagine was a scary, dark place with no internet access where I would be forced to isolate for two weeks while I lost my mind...</p>
        <p>The intravenous injection via which my medicine was administered was no picnic either, but I withstood the physical pain for about 20 minutes knowing I didn't have the coronavirus. After leaving the hospital on my way to grab lunch, I went on to Google what those words were on that piece of paper. It turns out I had a rare condition called pleurisy, which inflames the tissue that separates and therefore protects a person's lungs from their rib cage. The inflamed tissue was pressing against my lungs, which is why I felt like I couldn't breathe.</p>
        <p>It took me about a month to fully recover physically, but those first 24 hours were the most scared I have been throughout this ongoing pandemic.</p>

        <h2 id="blog2">My love affair with cooking</h2>
        <h6>Posted on 8-May-2021</h6>
        
        <p class="intro">When I was about 14 years of age, I visited my aunt at her farm on the outskirts of a small town in Kajiado County, Kenya. It was during the school holidays and my dad* felt it might be a good change of scenery from our usual school holidays routine. On one of those sunny mornings we were out tilling the land preparing it for planting maize, when my aunt, recounting her younger days, said (paraphrased) "your father used to make the best liver. He would come to us on a Sunday and say 'what do you want to eat' and we would say 'maini' (which is Swahili for liver)"</p>
        <p>When I was a young boy, six years of age, I lost my biological father. There is a lot of typically messy family drama that ensued, in which my brothers and I got separated from our mother, and over the next two years, my elder brother and I ended up living with my father's elder brother and my younger brother ended up living with my father's eldest sister. Given we were still very young, we grew accustomed to addressing the parents in our respective homes as our own. I got used to calling my uncle "dad" and he's regarded my brothers and I as his own children since. For the purposes of this blog, I will refer to him as dad*.</p>
        <p>Perhaps due to the drama that followed my biological father's death and the fact that dad* worked in the big city far away, we grew up in the care of a nanny at first and then went to boarding school shortly after. In those early years, I never cooked for myself, and up until I was 17 when I completed my high school education, also at boarding school, I never really knew how to cook. But, the story my aunt told me about my biological father that morning out on the farm always stuck with me. My father was a really good cook of liver.</p>
        <p>Having grown up under the care of the next best thing, when I did in fact start cooking for myself, this little piece of information became something I take great comfort in. It makes me feel a connection to my long-dead old man. Unsurprisingly, when I started cooking, my food was barely palatable. Looking back now, I'm convinced the only reason people were able to stomach my food is that, at the time, my house only had boys in it, and it is a commonly accepted idea in my country that boys will eat food, as long as it can be eaten, it doesn't have to taste particularly great. The only girl of the house was far away in another country making a life for herself. So, whatever I cooked, we ate. But I absolutely loved learning how to cook.</p>
        <p>It helps to assert my belief that my biological father was a good cook by describing my elder brother a little. He looks exactly like bio-dad, whatever little I can remember of his face and from the pictures hung about at my home back in the village. I sometimes even call him by our bio-dad's name. And he cooks really good food. I firmly believe that my brother's cooking is second only to my sister's in this house, and that because my sister has been cooking far longer than all us boys combined and can make a fair few more dishes. And, I really enjoy cooking too!</p>
        <p>I find that I'm able to pick up on preparing dishes rather quickly when am in the same kitchen with the person preparing that dish. I am a visual learner. My cooking improved drastically by watching my brother cook, and my sister later on when she came back from her time abroad. I would watch them, take note of the ingredients, how the food smelled while it was cooking, how they prepared and added the spices, what color the dishes would look like and then go on and try the same thing at first, gradually deviating and trying different things myself.</p>
        <p>I knew I loved cooking rather early on in my time as a the main cook in the house (my elder brother was off in University and usually took over the cooking when he'd be home for the weekend once a month), when dad* had got home from work one evening and my sister had just come to town for a brief stay, and dad* went on to praise my cooking to her. I've loved cooking ever since, holding onto the tale my aunt told me about bio-dad and knowing that dad* enjoys my cooking, except on those days when the hand that tips the salt tips a little too generously (my cooking has a fatal flaw that I can't seem to shake - I never taste the food while it's on the fire).</p>
